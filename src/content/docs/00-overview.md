`ghooey` is a solo proof-of-concept built in ~ 5 days during the **[LFGHO 2024 hackathon](https://ethglobal.com/events/lfgho)** built primarily with `Alpine.js` and `aave-utilities`

It is designed to be a **versatile drop-in front-end toolkit** to enable developers to **build and integrate Aave widgets in their existing codebase**. The baseline is to help promote the growth the adoption of web3 protocols in web2 products through **developer experience**.

By seamlessly integrating `ghooey` into their websites, developers would gain the ability to create tailor-made widgets, facilitating user onboarding onto the Aave ecosystem. It implements the rails to integrate the following features that would allow users to :

- Monitor their Aave portfolio
- Deposit and borrow liquidity from Aave markets
- Transfer liquidities and delegate their borrowing powers to other users

> The name **ghooey** is actually a play on words :
>
> - **GUI**, _Graphical User Interface_
> - **gooey**, as this toolkit aims to offer flexibility in terms of how to implement a feature
> - **GHO**, the Aave stablecoin and focus of the hackathon
